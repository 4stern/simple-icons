# Simple Icons – http://simpleicons.org

PNG icons in eleven sizes, from 16px to 4096px.

The Simple Icons set is a constant work in progress. New icons will appear over time. If you have a specific request—or a comment—create an <a href="https://github.com/danleech/simple-icons/issues">Issue</a> on this repository.

## Generics Branch

This branch is home to generic icons that I didn’t feel belonged in the main set. This may change one day, or I may decide to launch a spin-off set for these. In the meantime feel free to use them in your projects!
